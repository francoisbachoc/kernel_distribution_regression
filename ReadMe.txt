The folder Data should be created at the beginning at the same location as the scripts. After launching all computations, its size is about 35Mo

0. functions.R contains all relevant R functions for the study

1. Run RunRegressions_SW.R (computation time 1-3h, will create and delete .rda files in folder Data)

2. Run getRes.R (instantaneous, will generate figures)
